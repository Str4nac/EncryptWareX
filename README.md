# 🔐 EncryptWareX

**EncryptWareX** is a simple and powerful file encryption tool for Windows. It supports three encryption algorithms: **AES**, **RSA**, and **ChaCha20**, and comes as a standalone `.exe` file — no installation required.

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. Download the latest `EncryptWareX.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Str4nac/EncryptWareX/releases)
2. Create a folder and put `EncryptWareX.exe` inside it. This is necessary because the program will create three additional folders: logs, backups, and keys
3. Double-click to launch the app
4. The app might take some time to launch the first time
5. Follow the menu instructions

## 🛡️ Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm  | Extension | Description               |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| AES        | `.aes`    | Symmetric block cipher    |
| RSA        | `.rsa`    | Asymmetric key cipher     |
| ChaCha20   | `.cha`    | Symmetric stream cipher   |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- If you delete a **private RSA key**, you will not be able to decrypt files encrypted with it.
- Always keep your keys and backups in a safe place.
